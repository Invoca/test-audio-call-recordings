This repo contains audio files of phone calls for testing.

If you want to use Google Drive instead, [see these directions.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L9F_42aZIi4S7hNQFhdiMttkqbpK2AcRNUr0Q2uQE3c/edit#heading=h.tcs2ys2ixjkz)

To get the download url for a file, click on the file, then `Copy link address` from the `View raw` button, which adds `?raw=true` to the url.  

e.g., the following have been successfully ingested:
- https://github.com/Invoca/test-audio-call-recordings/raw/main/inbound-phone-call-2-seconds-caller-and-agent.mp3?raw=true  -- this one is nice and short (2 seconds) and small (31k) and ingests very quickly, and has both caller audio ("I am the caller") and agent audio ("I am the agent")
- https://github.com/Invoca/test-audio-call-recordings/blob/main/3-minute-call-2022-05-17.mp3?raw=true
